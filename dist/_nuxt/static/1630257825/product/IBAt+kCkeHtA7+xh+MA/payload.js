Following installation of the cable in the first leg of the duct route the balance of the cable is removed from the drum and fed into the Fleeter, thereby releasing the cable end ready for blowing into the second leg. The Fleeter provides a smooth and simple system whilst ensuring cable protection from pedestrians or vehicles and prevents contamination from mud, soil or dust. The Fleeter is designed to work in conjunction with the Cable Blowing Machine, which provides the cable feed in and out of the Fleeter. The unit accepts 3,000 metres of 13mm cable, allowing drum lengths of 6,000 metres to be utilised. The Fleeter consists of a road going trailer chassis upon which is mounted a cable storage cassette, rotating cable guide quadrant and duct clamp assembly.",img:[{image:c}],mainImg:c,subCategory:a,item:[{id:d,main:"Specifications",name:[{listItem:"Dimensions: 3.42m long x 2.3m wide x 2.33m high"},{listItem:"Tyre Size: 145R 10"},{listItem:"Brakes: Inertia type brakes with auto reverse"},{listItem:"Cassette: 2m x 0.85m high"},{listItem:"Rear Corner Steadies: 2 off"},{listItem:"Spirit Level Mounted: 1 off"},{listItem:"Width: 680mm"},{listItem:"Towing Hitch: Eye – 30mm, 40mm, Ball Type – 50mm, Specify at time of ordering"},{listItem:"325kg"}]}],intro:"The Fleeter replaces the manual method of “figure of eighting” cable, and provides protection and security for the cable.",video:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002F1wD6DOzn-Fg",configurationTitle:a,configurationIntro:a,configImage:a,tables:[],accessories:[],main_category:{id:d,name:"Fibre Blowing",image:"fibreblowing.svg",link:"\u002Ffibreblowing",text:"Our Fibre Blowing products contain Tornados, Jet Streams, Air Streams and more.
