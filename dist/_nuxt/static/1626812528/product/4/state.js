The system installs fibre optic cable of 6mm (0.25”) to 32mm (1.25”) overall diameter, at speeds up to 90m\u002Fmin (300ft\u002Fmin), into pre-installed ducts. The system operates on the viscous drag principle employing compressed air to install the cable, controlled and assisted by the belt drive system. The cable is propelled by compressed air, fed into the duct via a venturi principle, while the hydraulically powered belt drive system controls the fibre optic cable. The electronic monitoring system provides read out of speed and distance, gives protection against duct obstructions and includes an emergency stop facility. The system is mounted on an anti-corrosion treated, sturdy, height adjustable, wheeled, tubular steel trolley. This allows the unit to be wheeled around on site.

A range of Overblowing junction box collets and seals are available to suit the outside diameter of the existing sub-duct, existing cable, cable to be installed and slave length of tube for cable to be installed.

The single capstan allows the winch to be placed at the mid point of a section to assist in the pull, thus enabling longer pulls to be achieved. The C-1045 has a rope take up drum, which is driven independently via a hydraulic motor. The take up drum has a detachable side, which allows the rope on the drum to be removed in a tidy coil and can be declutched from the drive to allow the rope to be pulled out manually when threading. The winch is powered by a 13hp petrol engine that drives a fixed displacement hydraulic pump, which in turn drives the low speed, high torque, hydraulic motor. The motor drives the capstan through an epicyclical gearbox. The pulling tension is mounted on a dial read out, allowing the operator to monitor the pull. Tension is adjustable from 0 – 500kg. The winch will stop pulling at the selected tension without stopping the engine, thereby protecting the cable. The C-1045 is built on a robust steel chassis. The trailer equipment complies with European Standards and has a single axle, overrun brakes and jockey wheel.",img:[{image:"winch\u002Fwinch-1.jpeg"},{image:dz},{image:"winch\u002Fwinch-3.jpeg"},{image:"winch\u002Fwinch-4.jpeg"},{image:"winch\u002Fwinch-5.jpeg"},{image:"winch\u002Fwinch-6.jpeg"},{image:"winch\u002Fwinch-7.jpeg"},{image:"winch\u002Fwinch-8.jpeg"},{image:"winch\u002Fwinch-9.jpeg"}],mainImg:dz,category:f,item:[{id:e,main:k,name:[{listItem:"Engine: 13hp"},{listItem:"Capacity: 500kg"},{listItem:"Rope Speed (Max): 50m\u002Fmin"},{listItem:"Capstan Diameter: 813mm"},{listItem:"Adjustable Tension: 0-500kg"},{listItem:"Length (Min): 3200mm"},{listItem:"Length (Max): 3436mm"},{listItem:"Width: 1750mm"},{listItem:"Height: 1440mm"},{listItem:"Weight: 580kg"}]}],intro:dy,video:a,configurationTitle:a,configurationIntro:a,configImage:a,tables:[],accessories:[]}],featuredProducts:[{name:m,elevation:c,color:d,id:g,productId:h,intro:aM,mainImg:o},{name:m,elevation:c,color:d,id:g,productId:h,intro:V,mainImg:o},{name:m,elevation:c,color:d,id:g,productId:h,intro:V,mainImg:o}],blogStories:[{id:e,img:aP,heading:"We're 50!",subheading:"Join us as we reminisce!",description:"CBS Products is celebrating it's 50th anniversary this year, and what a ride it's been!
