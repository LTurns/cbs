The system installs fibre optic cable of 6mm (0.25”) to 32mm (1.25”) overall diameter, at speeds up to 90m\u002Fmin (300ft\u002Fmin), into pre-installed ducts. The system operates on the viscous drag principle employing compressed air to install the cable, controlled and assisted by the belt drive system. The cable is propelled by compressed air, fed into the duct via a venturi principle, while the hydraulically powered belt drive system controls the fibre optic cable. The electronic monitoring system provides read out of speed and distance, gives protection against duct obstructions and includes an emergency stop facility. The system is mounted on an anti-corrosion treated, sturdy, height adjustable, wheeled, tubular steel trolley. This allows the unit to be wheeled around on site. The C-1203 hydraulic petrol driven power pack provides power. The unit is CE approved.",img:[{image:i},{image:"tornado\u002Ftornado-1.jpeg"},{image:"tornado\u002Ftornado-2.jpeg"},{image:"tornado\u002Ftornado-3.jpeg"},{image:"tornado\u002Ftornado-4.jpeg"},{image:"tornado\u002Ftornado-5.jpeg"},{image:"tornado\u002Ftornado-6.jpeg"},{image:"tornado\u002Ftornado-7.jpeg"}],mainImg:i,category:a,subCategory:[],item:[{id:1,main:"Fully labelled control panel containing:",name:[{listItem:"Power on\u002Foff button"},{listItem:"Emergency stop button"},{listItem:"Reset button"},{listItem:"Combined length counter recording in metres (feet) and cable speed read out in metres\u002Fmin (feet\u002Fmin)"},{listItem:"Air pressure read out dial"},{listItem:"Hydraulic on\u002Foff control valve"},{listItem:"Adjustable speed control for drive belts"},{listItem:"Air supply control on\u002Foff with automatic exhaust function"}]},{id:2,main:"Air Box",name:[{listItem:"Manufactured in aluminium"},{listItem:"Range taking of cables from 6mm – 32mm (0.25”-1.25”) by means of interchangeable collets with double cable sealing arrangement"},{listItem:"Duct sealing at mouth of air box"},{listItem:"Duct gripping facility designed to obviate duct crushing and distortion"},{listItem:"No tools are required to split air box for insertion of cable and duct"},{listItem:"All seals, except cable seals, have a common diameter cord"},{listItem:"Upper section of air box is retained"},{listItem:"Air box aligned is adjustable for varying cable diameters"},{listItem:"On\u002Foff air control valve with automatic air exhaust from duct when in “off” position"}]},{id:3,main:"Chassis",name:[{listItem:"Front mounted wheels for ease of manoeuvrability"},{listItem:"Lightweight anti-corrosion treated tubular steel frame"},{listItem:"Adjustable frame allowing unit to be tilted up to 30°, reducing bending of duct and cable"},{listItem:"Adjustable rear legs for uneven terrain"}]},{id:j,main:"Storage Case Comprising Of:",name:[{listItem:"Operating Manual"},{listItem:"Instructional Video"}]},{id:5,main:"Cable Feeder",name:[{listItem:"Manufactured in cast aluminium"},{listItem:"Hydraulically powered"},{listItem:"Unit lifts and splits to allow insertion of cable between drive belts"},{listItem:"Drive belts are profiled polyurethane, moulded"},{listItem:"Belt tension can be set by means of adjustable chain drive tensioners fitted to the side of the unit"},{listItem:"System relief valve fitted as standard"}]},{id:6,main:"Tool Box",name:[{listItem:"3mm Allen Key"},{listItem:"3mm dia.
