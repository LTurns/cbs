The single capstan allows the winch to be placed at the mid point of a section to assist in the pull, thus enabling longer pulls to be achieved. The C-1045 has a rope take up drum, which is driven independently via a hydraulic motor. The take up drum has a detachable side, which allows the rope on the drum to be removed in a tidy coil and can be declutched from the drive to allow the rope to be pulled out manually when threading. The winch is powered by a 13hp petrol engine that drives a fixed displacement hydraulic pump, which in turn drives the low speed, high torque, hydraulic motor. The motor drives the capstan through an epicyclical gearbox. The pulling tension is mounted on a dial read out, allowing the operator to monitor the pull. Tension is adjustable from 0 â€“ 500kg. The winch will stop pulling at the selected tension without stopping the engine, thereby protecting the cable. The C-1045 is built on a robust steel chassis. The trailer equipment complies with European Standards and has a single axle, overrun brakes and jockey wheel.",img:[{image:"winch\u002Fwinch-1.jpeg"},{image:c},{image:"winch\u002Fwinch-3.jpeg"},{image:"winch\u002Fwinch-4.jpeg"},{image:"winch\u002Fwinch-5.jpeg"},{image:"winch\u002Fwinch-6.jpeg"},{image:"winch\u002Fwinch-7.jpeg"},{image:"winch\u002Fwinch-8.jpeg"},{image:"winch\u002Fwinch-9.jpeg"}],mainImg:c,category:"Fibre Blowing",subCategory:[],item:[{id:1,main:"Specifications:",name:[{listItem:"Engine: 13hp"},{listItem:"Capacity: 500kg"},{listItem:"Rope Speed (Max): 50m\u002Fmin"},{listItem:"Capstan Diameter: 813mm"},{listItem:"Adjustable Tension: 0-500kg"},{listItem:"Length (Min): 3200mm"},{listItem:"Length (Max): 3436mm"},{listItem:"Width: 1750mm"},{listItem:"Height: 1440mm"},{listItem:"Weight: 580kg"}]}],intro:"The C-1045 winch has been designed to meet the requirements of installing telecommunication cables, employing an 813mm diameter single capstan to impact a controlled force to the pulling rope or cable.",video:a,configurationTitle:a,configurationIntro:a,configImage:a,tables:[],accessories:[]}]}},mutations:[]}}("","DNXxPH1ZWkCr9LJr5VFIZg","winch\u002Fwinch-2.jpeg")));
