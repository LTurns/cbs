            <p>
              CBS remains open and are working hard to provide essential
              services to our telecommunications and electricity industries
              during these difficult and uncertain times. We want to assure you
              that we are taking the current situation very seriously, we have
              staff working from home where possible and have implemented extra
              precautions throughout the building to ensure the health and
              safety of our staff, customers and suppliers. As you will be
              aware, the situation is constantly changing, as is the advice
              issued by the Government and the World Health Organisation.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a company, we will be listening to the official advice and will
              act in accordance with it, together with reacting to the
              situations of both our customers and suppliers, many of which are
              already operating at reduced levels. Our business may be disrupted
              at some point in the future but, for now, it is business as usual.
              Our thoughts are with those who have been affected by the spread
              of COVID-19. Please, follow the advise issued by the Government
              and W.H.O. Stay Safe.
